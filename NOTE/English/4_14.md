# China's Wisdom for the World
    Ladies and gentlemen, good morning! It's my great priviedge to stand here delivering the speech--China's Wisdom for the World and particularly, China High-speed Railway.
    How did you guys travel between school and home?大巴/高铁/飞机/家长接送？
    Always, I will choose the high speed train.
    当我8岁的时候，我第一次出远门，那个时候还坐不起高铁。Once when I was 8 years old, I went to the modern city "Shanghai" from my hometown--a vibrant village in anhui province. As my parents both worked there, it's clearly why I was brought there by my meemaw.  It's such a long trip, and we stayed on the train almost 5 hours. when I smoothly encountered my parents in shanghai, they took eat a plate of dumplings. Amazingly, I drink the vinegar directly  because the dumplings are so delicious for me. 
    Nowadays, I luckily become a college student in Shandong prinvince. Thanks to the CHSR, Within the same 5 hours I can achieve this city from my home. Most of us college students get approach of the high train at the September to acquire higher education, so do I.
    One score year ago, the high train just began to consturct.

在经济全球化发展这一不可阻挡的潮流下，中国高铁带给世界的不只是一种技术，更是帮助世界各国提出了交流互鉴、融合发展的解决方案。乘着“一带一路”倡议的东风，将基础设施建设视作全球联结和社会经济发展的基石，代表着全球可持续发展的一种新模式。

Ladies and gentlemen,good morning! It's my great privilege to stand here delivering the speech--China's wisdom for the world.
Before we start the speech, I have a question for you guys: How do you travel between school and home?
Bus?Train?Plan?
For me, the first choice is always the High Speed RailWay.
Dated back to 10 years ago, I was 8 years old and first time leaving my vibrant hometown int Anhui province to Shanghai  to spend the summer holiday there. As
my parents both worked there, my meemaw bring us and took 5 hours through the green train.
Today, the same 5 hours I can reach here, the Shandong province from my home with the High Speed Train. 它切实地缩短了出行的时间，让远行变得不再昂贵（both in time and money）.
徐霞客有言，大丈夫当朝游碧海而暮苍梧。“世界是一本书，不旅行的人只读了其中的一页。”圣奥古斯丁也说。
“The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.” ——Saint Augustine. Had it not been for its construction, we wouldn't become the unity today.

The Chinese railway, like a soaring dragon, traverses the towering mountains of Asia, gallops across the vast prairies of Africa, spans the rivers and mountains of Europe, and delves deep into the tropical rainforests of South America. In Serbia, we forge a new chapter of European speed; in East Africa, we weave the brilliant dream of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway; in Indonesia, we pen the legendary tale of the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway; in Mexico, we pave the hopeful future of the Maya Train. Whether it be the ancient civilizations of Asia, the fertile lands of Africa, the romantic allure of Europe, or the mysterious charm of South America, all have borne the indelible mark of Chinese railways, testifying to the grandeur of Chinese wisdom and strength.
A score years ago, we start the long journey 
## 太极
高中的时候，学校处于“野蛮其心灵，强健其体魄”的想法，三年持之以恒地保留了早操和大课间两个运动时间段。甚至于，在高二，我们利用大课间学习了二十四式简化太极拳并且极其幸运地在运动会开幕式上一起表演了这个项目。你们了解太极吗？至少我不了解。当时，我的理解就是，打的慢一点，动作做大一点，最好下一式的提示词开始报了，你这一式才做完。我这也是和我们班同学学的，他们都做的很慢。实际我对这项运动一点不理解，也没什么气血通畅的感觉，反而是急着写作业每天都气血上涌。
我不行有人行啊，我们学校有一老哥，复读生，每天吃完晚饭会到操场上打半个小时太极，后来他去了北大。至此，我对太极的观感就升华了，静，如
去年，八段锦在全网爆火，和太极一样，作为传统健身方式，不像“撸铁/跳操”一样成果显著，不如“篮球/足球”热血沸腾。但是，作为一种时代的叩问，我们的焦虑，我们的浮躁，我们的郁郁不得志，在这样一招一式中化解。
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning! It's my great privilege to stand here delivering the speech--China's wisdom for the world.
Dated back to my senior high school period, with the aim of "Strengthening their spritual and polinsh their body", my school utilize the dakejian to teach us the 24 easy Tachi and luckily permanate it at the sporting meeting. Have you guys being pushed to play Tachi? As a stupid teenager in execellent age, it feels like the music along with it wouldn't ended. All I know about this kind of sport is to play as slow as possible, but without the silence coming from my heart, it still didn't work perfectly.
A year later, my xuezhang, a fudusheng having a mysterious experience between our village school and the top scool in central city, pass the compulsory examination and suscessfully got into the Peking University as rank one in our province. He has a habit to play Tachi in the dinner break. The celebrating atmosphere and my desperate grades make me escape from the real world and devote myself into the virtual world. Fortunately, escapeing is down but useful. 
起势与收势之间展现的是
The silence arise from your heart from the commencement to the closing form. The peace spreads in your body during the white crane spreads its wings and the step, parry and punch. The hope finnaly immerse you in the open and close.
The silence arises from your heart, deep and still, from the commencement to the closing form. The peace spreads in your body, serene and广泛, as the white crane gracefully spreads its wings and executes the step, parry, and punch. The hope finally immerses you, bright and unwavering, in the opening and closing of each movement.
Last year,八段锦爆火全网
