# China's Wisdom for the World
    Ladies and gentlemen, good morning! It's my great priviedge to stand here delivering the speech--China's Wisdom for the World and particularly, China High-speed Railway.
    How did you guys travel between school and home?大巴/高铁/飞机/家长接送？
    Always, I will choose the high speed train.
    当我8岁的时候，我第一次出远门，那个时候还坐不起高铁。Once when I was 8 years old, I went to the modern city "Shanghai" from my hometown--a vibrant village in anhui province. As my parents both worked there, it's clearly why I was brought there by my meemaw.  It's such a long trip, and we stayed on the train almost 5 hours. when I smoothly encountered my parents in shanghai, they took eat a plate of dumplings. Amazingly, I drink the vinegar directly  because the dumplings are so delicious for me. 
    Nowadays, I luckily become a college student in Shandong prinvince. Thanks to the CHSR, Within the same 5 hours I can achieve this city from my home. Most of us college students get approach of the high train at the September to acquire higher education, so do I.
    One score year ago, the high train just began to consturct.
